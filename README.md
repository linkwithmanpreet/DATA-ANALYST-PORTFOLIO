# DATA-ANALYST-PORTFOLIO
👋 Hi, I'm Manpreet Singh – Data Analyst
Welcome to my GitHub! 🌟

I specialize in data analysis, with experience across a variety of projects that include data cleaning, visualization, statistical analysis, and reporting. My work spans different industries, ensuring relevance to the challenges I tackle. I focus on writing clean, well-documented code, following best practices to make it easy to understand and maintain. 🧹💻

In my projects, you’ll see how I handle raw data, perform thorough exploratory data analysis (EDA), and use tools like Python, SQL, R, and Excel to derive insights. I also create clear visualizations 📊 and concise reports 📑, often leveraging libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, and tools like PowerBI.

I’m comfortable with a range of data science tools 🛠️ and technologies, and I make regular use of version control to keep my work organized and collaborative. Each project I work on is approached with a clear problem statement, thoughtful methodology, and a focus on the real-world impact of the results. 🎯

Feel free to explore my work, where you’ll find a mix of technical depth and practical applications. If you have any questions or ideas, I’m happy to connect. 🤝
